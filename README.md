## Solved bugs  
* When I ran my code through the W3C validator, I was given an error message saying there was an invalid percentage value for one of the grid-template-rows. This was fixed by changing the value to auto.
* Another error i received when using the W3C validator was that I did not quote my font-family value so I went back to the code and added them in.
* When testing the links in the header section they would not work. I fixed this by adding a height to the header which fixed the problem.

## Unsolved bugs
* Background image not loading on mobile devices.

## Testing
* ### Validator testing
* 
* Lighthouse testing
