*   ### Future features

    * Another feature I would like to implement down the line is the ability to book classes online rather than having to call everytime.

## Solved bugs  
* When I ran my code through the W3C validator, I was given an error message saying there was an invalid percentage value for one of the grid-template-rows. This was fixed by changing the value to auto.
* Another error i received when using the W3C validator was that I did not quote my font-family value so I went back to the code and added them in.
* When testing the links in the header section they would not work. I fixed this by adding a height to the header which fixed the problem.
* The background image on the form section was not loading on some mobile devices and some web browsers so I converted the image to WEBP and this fixed the problem. 

## Testing
### Validator testing
* HTML
    * The W3C Markup validator was used to check the html code and returned with no errors.
    ![HTML Validation](/assets/images/html-validation.jpg) 
* CSS
    * The W3C CSS validator was used to validate the css code and returned with no errors.
    ![CSS Validation](/assets/images/css-validation.jpg) 
* Lighthouse 
    * Lighthouse was used to test the accessability of the website and to make sure the fonts and colors used are easily read.
    ![Lighthouse](/assets/images/lighthouse.jpg) 
* ### Responsiveness 
    * I tested the page throughout my project using chrome developer tools.
    * I have tested the website is responsive on all sizes of devices and that all text is easily readable.

## Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
1. From the github repository click on "settings" from the navigation bar.
2. Click on "pages" from navigation section on the left.
3. In the "source" section choose which branch you want to use from the dropdown menu, it will usually be the "main".
4. Select which folder you want to use, in most cases its the "/root".
5. Hit the "save" button, then wait for your site to be published.(This can take some time.)
6. When your site is ready and published the link will be above the "source" section
